## Data setup and prerequisites

Install the `KelpAreaIndicator` package from the SCCWRP github repository and load it.

```{r load_package}
# devtools::install_github(
#   "SCCWRP/KelpAreaIndicator",
#   build_vignettes = TRUE,
#   build_manual = TRUE
# )
library(KelpAreaIndicator)
```

Provide the file paths to the Landsat kelp area data, downloaded from the [EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=74), and the shapefile that defines the kelp segment polygons of interest. The kelp segments shapefile is a polygon shapefile with at least one attribute, `Segment_ID`, that defines the kelp area segments of interest.

```{r setup}
lter_file_path <- "../data/LandsatKelpBiomass_2023_Q3_withmetadata.nc"
kelp_segments_file_path <- "../data/uswc_2023_v1"
```

## Assigning segments to Landsat pixels

The `segment_landsat_data()` function will load the Landsat netCDF file and assign each pixel to its respective segment, defined in the kelp segments shapefile. Each pixel in the Landsat data represents a 900 m$^2$ area, so the `segment_landsat_data()` function provides an option to treat the area values as either 0 or 900 m$^2$, rather than the fractional value between 0 and 900, with the `fractional_pixels` parameter. Setting `fractional_pixels = FALSE` will enable this binary treatment of the pixel data.

The resulting data frame consists of rows of pixels from the Landsat data, and columns of quarters for each year of the time series. The `Segment_ID` column indicates which segment that the pixel belongs to. The `lon` and `lat` columns are the longitude and latitude of the pixel, respectively. The remaining columns represent the quarterly kelp area time series of that pixel, in m$^2$.


```{r segment_data}
segmented_landsat_data <- segment_landsat_data(
  lter_file_path = lter_file_path,
  kelp_segments_file_path = kelp_segments_file_path
)

segmented_landsat_data
```

```{r segment_data_whole}
segmented_landsat_data_whole_pixels <- segment_landsat_data(
  lter_file_path = lter_file_path,
  kelp_segments_file_path = kelp_segments_file_path,
  fractional_pixels = FALSE
)

segmented_landsat_data_whole_pixels
```
If a kelp segment never contains any pixels with kelp coverage, these segments are represented by a single row of `NA` values for the entire time series.
```{r show_na_segment}
segmented_landsat_data |>
  dplyr::filter(Segment_ID == "CA_103")
```

## Kelp presence

Some of the designated kelp segments may have limited data points in the Landsat kelp area data, so it is useful to classify the presence of kelp within each kelp segment. We provide the `get_kelp_presence()` function to do this. The current categories are "No Historical Kelp", "Ephemeral Kelp", and "Kelp", defined by the `no_kelp_bound` and `ephemeral_kelp_bound` arguments, discussed below.

This function will first calculate the percentage of area of each kelp segment that kelp has ever been detected in. That is, distinct pixels that have ever had kelp area greater than 0 within a segment are tallied, then this number of pixels is multiplied by 900 m$^2$ (the maximum possible area per 30 m $\times$ 30 m pixel), converted to km$^2$, and then divided by the kelp segment's area in km$^2$. This final ratio is multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage. 

After the above percentage is calculated, the function will categorize each kelp segment according to the bounds set with the `no_kelp_bound` and `ephemeral_kelp_bound` arguments. These are both upper bounds for their respective categories, so for example, if `no_kelp_bound = 0.02`, then kelp segments with a kelp presence percentage of 0.01% will be categorized as "No Historical Kelp"; similarly for "Ephemeral Kelp". The defaults for these arguments are `no_kelp_bound = 0.02` and `ephemeral_kelp_bound = 0.15`.

The result of the function is a data frame with the following columns:

* `Segment_ID`: The ID of the kelp area segment
* `segment_area`: The area of the kelp segment in km2
* `pixel_percent`: The percentage of the kelp segment's area that the total number of pixels ever detected occupy. This calculation assumes each pixel contains the full 900 m2 of kelp area
* `presence`: The category of kelp presence for each segment.

    * "No Historical Kelp": pixel_percent <= no_kelp_bound OR pixel_percent is NA
    * "Ephemeral Kelp": pixel_percent <= ephemeral_kelp_bound
    * "Kelp": otherwise

```{r kelp_presence}
kelp_presence <- get_kelp_presence(
  segmented_landsat_data = segmented_landsat_data,
  kelp_segments_file_path = kelp_segments_file_path,
  no_kelp_bound = 0.02,
  ephemeral_kelp_bound = 0.15
)

kelp_presence |> dplyr::arrange(Segment_ID)
```

## Extracting time series
The quarterly Landsat time series is extracted with the `extract_time_series()` function. This function aggregates the Landsat data per segment, and either the quarterly or annualized time series for each segment can be extracted. A subset of the kelp segments can be extracted using the `segment_id` parameter.

### Quarterly time series
The quarterly time series is aggregated by summing the quarterly area data for all pixels within each segment. The resulting data frame contains 9 columns:

* `Segment_ID`: The ID of the kelp area segment
* `max_occupiable`: The maximum occupiable kelp area for the given segment. This column repeats the same value for all rows in a single kelp area segment
* `historical_med`: The historical (1984-2013) median kelp area for the segment. The median is computed across the annualized kelp area values. This column repeats the same value for all rows in a single kelp area segment
* `quarter`: The quarter in the time series. Not present in the annual time series
* `year`: Year in the time series
* `date`: Date representation of the year/quarter, for simpler plotting
* `area_abs`: Kelp area in absolute magnitude, in km$^2$
* `area_hist`: Kelp area relative to the historical median, expressed as a percentage
* `area_pct`: Kelp area relative to the maximum occupiable kelp area, expressed as a percentage

```{r quarterly_ts}
quarterly_ts <- extract_time_series(
  segmented_landsat_data = segmented_landsat_data,
  frequency = "quarterly"
)

quarterly_ts
```


### Annual time series
We provide several options for annualizing the quarterly Landsat area data, `max_first`, `sum_first`, or extracting a specific quarter for each year, discussed below. The annualized time series data frame is identical to the quarterly time series data, except there is no `quarter` column.

Note that the historical median area (`historical_med`) and maximum occupiable area (`max_occupiable`) are given per `Segment_ID`, repeated for every row of its time series. The historical median is calculated across the *annualized* values from 1984 to 2013, inclusive.

The `max_first` annualization method will loop through all Landsat pixels and for each year of the time series, it will select the maximum value that that pixel attained in that year. Then, these maximum values are added together for all pixels in each segment, so that the resulting time series is annual for each kelp segment.
```{r max_first_annual_ts}
max_first_annual_ts <- extract_time_series(
  segmented_landsat_data = segmented_landsat_data,
  annualization_method = "max_first"
)

max_first_annual_ts
```

The `sum_first` method will sum the time series for all pixels in each kelp segment, so that each kelp segment has a quarterly time series. Then, the maximum for each segment within each year is selected, so that the time series is annual.

```{r sum_first_annual_ts}
sum_first_annual_ts <- extract_time_series(
  segmented_landsat_data = segmented_landsat_data,
  annualization_method = "sum_first"
)

sum_first_annual_ts
```

Each of the `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`, and `Q4` options will sum together all pixels within each segment and extract its respective quarter within each year.
```{r q3_annual_ts}
q3_annual_ts <- extract_time_series(
  segmented_landsat_data = segmented_landsat_data,
  annualization_method = "Q3"
)

q3_annual_ts
```


## Plotting time series
Compare different methods of annualization applied to the `CA_78` segment below. The `plot_time_series()` function is a convenience function to plot the time series for a particular segment. Here, we've modified it and added more `ggplot2` line layers to visualize the difference between the `max_first`, `sum_first`, and `Q3` annualization methods.
```{r time_series_plot_comparison, fig.dpi=300, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7.11, out.height="400px", out.width="95%", fig.align='center'}
# combine all methods into a single data frame for plotting
annual_ts <- dplyr::bind_rows(
  max_first_annual_ts |> dplyr::mutate(method = "Max first"),
  sum_first_annual_ts |> dplyr::mutate(method = "Sum first"),
  q3_annual_ts |> dplyr::mutate(method = "Quarter 3")
)

# for grey background lines in plot
other_ts <- annual_ts |>
  dplyr::filter(Segment_ID == "CA_78") |>
  dplyr::rename(others = method)

plot_time_series(
  kelp_area_time_series = annual_ts,
  type = "absolute",
  segment_id = "CA_78",
  color = method
) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(
    data = other_ts,
    mapping = ggplot2::aes(x = date, y = area_abs, group = others),
    alpha = 0.15,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +
  ggplot2::scale_x_date(date_breaks = "4 years", date_labels = "%Y") +
  ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_d() +
  ggplot2::labs(color = "Annualization\nMethod") +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(ggplot2::vars(method), scales = "free_x")
```


## Kelp status
The status of kelp segments can be computed for years after the historical baseline (1984 - 2013) with the `get_kelp_status()` function. This function uses the computed time series and kelp presence data frames from the `extract_time_series()` and `get_kelp_presence()` functions, respectively. Individual kelp segments or subsets of kelp segments may be specified with the `segment_id` argument, and the desired year may be specified with the `status_year` argument. The function will return the status for all segments if `segment_id = NULL` (default) or for the latest year in the Landsat data if `status_year = NULL` (default). 

Status is calculated by dividing the given year's kelp area by the historical median across 1984-2013 for each kelp segment. A value of -999 indicates that there is not enough data to determine a status for the given kelp segment.

```{r kelp_status_2020}
kelp_status_2020 <- get_kelp_status(
  annual_time_series = sum_first_annual_ts,
  kelp_presence = kelp_presence,
  status_year = 2020
)

kelp_status_2020
```

```{r kelp_status_CA_78}
kelp_status_CA_78 <- get_kelp_status(
  annual_time_series = sum_first_annual_ts,
  kelp_presence = kelp_presence,
  segment_id = "CA_78"
)

kelp_status_CA_78
```
